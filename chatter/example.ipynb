The harsh blue glare of acetylene torches and welding irons send horrifying shadows into the upper reaches of the chamber. The thunk and groan of heavily machinery echo like tourists' calls into the Grand Canyon. The hanger is 800 feet long. Hundreds of workers labor in every corner of the massive hanger. Most of them swarming over ... The skeletal frame of the Hercules' fuselage. The combination of wood and plastic molding soars up, disappearing into the darkness of the top of the cathedral. Howard is particularly intense -- .in overdrive -- his mind racing, battling to keep up with the many, many pressures of his life. He flips through renderings for a new TWA logo as he walks, tossing aside those he doesn't like -- which is all of them. An AIDE scurries behind and picks up the discarded renderings.

Bold red-and-white TWA colors on the Connies. Howard is a skeleton. He has lost 35 pounds off his already lean frame. He is weak, walking with a cane, trying to focus. It is soon apparent that his face will never be what it was. Plastic surgery has helped, but he has lost much of the natural elasticity on the left side of his face. His amazingly pure beauty is just gone, although a darker, more saturnine intensity gives his face a very corrrrnanding aspect. He now sports a mustache to cover a scar above his lip.\n",

The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facial paralysis, and has given him a nickname: HAPPY JACK MULRANEY. Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bends down over a wooden cage full of rabbits. He slowly moves the candle back and forth across the cage top. Wax falls on the cage, splattering an unlucky rabbit. Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body. He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves.\n",

Then a little WIDER to reveal: an eager boy, SHANG DRAPER, about the same age as Amsterdam. He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of the rat, then sews it closed. He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging it as he stands up. He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers crude weapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN. The floor is covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sew into his rat. Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons. And now we see this room full. It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowded with families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; men and women, together or separately, drunk or passed out. They are like zoo animals in a pit. There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or, more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries. Above Shang's head, VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge that spans the room a hundred feet beneath them. Armed men and women from the Brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them. Shang SCURRIES up after them. The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the others in the lead. Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front: Amsterdam. He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog.\n",
      "And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl across Paradise Square into BATTLE. VALLON draws first blood. He impales a Native American on the sword end of his cross and turns to fight again. Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder.\n",
      "Then a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood. The boys act together. Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling. Shang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like a blackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapses unconscicus at their feet. Before the boys can thank one another, however, they are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them. BILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a man's skull, then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm.

      "Dill is having sex with a woman called CONSTANCE. The curtains are half open and we glimpse the slick water of the dock reflecting the lights of the village. Somewhere, someone is playing tango music and we hear people talking and laughing outside. Constance is late forties, beautiful still but not so sure anymore. We watch Dill do something that he does very well and, soon after we join them, Constance reaches orgasm. Dill rolls away. A moment taken by the tango music and then some applause (as if applauding Dill’s performance). Constance sits up and lights a cigarette which she will share with Dill. As she shakes her match...\n",

      "It is another perfect day in paradise. A flat ocean is an empty blue page apart from a single white dot. We move across the water toward the dot and see a tuna fishing boat at anchor with outriggers loaded and lines in the water. As we approach we see the name of the boat is ‘Serenity’ out of Plymouth Island. We board the boat and find hot, woozy silence, apart from a beer bottle that rolls very, very slowly with the almost nonexistent swell. This is a boat that is waiting for fate to take a hand, waiting for the moment of ecstasy, the moment when a big fat blue fin tuna takes the bait and all hell will break loose. Until then, this is a time out of time, when nothing happens and nothing matters apart from the line, the hook and the fish. A hook and knife scarred tattooed hand picks up the rolling bottle and drops it in a trash bucket with some anger. We rise from the hand to discover the men aboard the Serenity. The scarred hand belongs to the skipper of the vessel, BAKER DILL. He is late thirties, a creature of the ocean, half crusted in salt and dressed in rolled up chinos and a T shirt bleached by a thousand voyages. His hair is dressed by the ocean and the wind. He is taking the silence and the lack of a bite personally and he’s getting madder with every silent tick of the clock. He gets a calming glance from his first mate, DUKE. Duke is a man of every race mixed and is greying into his fiftieth year. He will become a fish one day and he knows the ocean even better than Baker Dill. Duke glances up at a Frigate bird which is circling over head. The frigate is a giant, prehistoric looking sea bird that soars above the ocean on warm air currents, flapping its wings maybe twice a day. It is the spirit of the ocean and is made out of time. Fishermen know that where the frigate circles there will be mackerel and jacks, and where there are mackerel and jacks, there should be tuna. That’s the theory.... In response to the bird, Duke goes to tighten a line. As we follow him we find two AMERICAN TOURISTS, both fast asleep in the game fishing chairs which are bolted side-by-side to the deck. The chairs have seat belts to prevent the fisherman being pulled into the ocean. The seat belts are unbuckled and dangle, swaying gently.\n",
