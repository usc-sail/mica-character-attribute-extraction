      "At an abandoned hotel, a police squad corners [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]], who overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing [[Telephone booth|public telephone]] and vanishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known by his [[Security hacker|hacking]] [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix\". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape. The Agents offer to erase Neo's criminal record in exchange for his help with locating Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses to cooperate, they fuse his mouth shut, pin him down, and implant a robotic \"bug\" in his abdomen. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morpheus offers Neo [[red pill and blue pill|a choice between two pills]]: Taking the red pill, which will reveal the truth about the Matrix, or  the blue, which will make Neo forget everything and return to his former life. Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort, awakening in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus's flying ship, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: In the early 21st century, a war broke out between humanity and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. After humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their [[Bioelectricity|bioelectric]] power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]].\n",
      "\n",
      "Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix kills the physical body too and explains that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels eliminate rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual training cements Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], a prophet-like program who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police ambush the group, tipped off by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who has betrayed Morpheus in exchange for a deal to be plugged back into the Matrix to live a comfortable life.\n",
      "\n",
      "To buy time for the others, Morpheus fights Smith and is captured. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders the other crew members as they lie unconscious. Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity, crew member Tank regains consciousness and kills him before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and kills Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived, with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix; he easily defeats Smith, prompting the other Agents to flee and he leaves the Matrix just as the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] disables the Sentinels. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a telephone call, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible.\" He hangs up and flies away.\n",

      "The philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.<ref>Irwin, William. \"We Are (the) One!\" ''The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real''.
