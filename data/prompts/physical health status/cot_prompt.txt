Passage: And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall, holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so * by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need that he might have.
Character: HECTOR
Answer: The passage describes Hector as "clean-shaven and more healthy-looking" and as being "alert to any hint of need" from his master. This suggests that Hector is physically fit and able to perform his duties as a personal body slave. Therefore, the answer is "Physically fit".
