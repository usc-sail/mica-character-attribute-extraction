# Character Attribute Extraction

Character attribute extraction is an *information extraction* task to find attribute-frames from a narrative text.
Attribute frames are *(character, attribute-type, attribute-value, passage)* tuples, where the passage is taken from the
narrative text and it describes some attribute, of type defined by *attribute-type* and value represented by
*attribute-value*, of the character.
