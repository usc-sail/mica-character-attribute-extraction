# Character Attribution

Character attributes define the physical, emotional, social, economic, and professional status of a character.

The task of character attribution is to retrieve the attributes described or those that can be inferred about the
characters mentioned in a story passage.
We can operationalize it as the structured information extraction task of attribute-frames, wherein each attribute-frame
contains fields for the character, attribute-type, and attribute-value.

### Setup

Refer to packages.txt.

We will convert it to a conda environment file soon.

### Files

The files are named according to their order of execution.
