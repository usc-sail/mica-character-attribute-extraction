Almost a shrink ' s probing bedside manner . He has great interest in the world as he moves through it . As if he originally came from a different world and his survival in this one depends on close continual observation and analysis . YOUNG COLIN looks up . CLOSE ON his eyes . He is fourteen or fifteen , but small for his age . Bookish . COSTELLO eyes the proprietor ' s TEENAGE DAUGHTER , working behind the counter . He takes a propane lighter , and , strangely , pays for it ( the proprietor startled ) and waits for change . He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter .\n",
