       " 'text': \"In A Song of Ice and Fire, Stannis Baratheon more or less admits that he would be a king of this type if he manages to win the throne in the current civil war. The populace would hate his guts because he's a stern, taciturn Knight Templar, the nobility would hate him because of his complete unwillingness to budge on so much as what appetizers to serve at dinner, and his own supporters and bannermen would hate him because he would treat them just as harshly as he would his own enemies. The only reason he even wants the throne stems from the reason he would be so bad at it: as his elder brother's heir following the former king's illegitimate children, he sees the throne as legally his, despite the fact that almost no one, including himself, actually wants him to hold it. His most fervent supporter, Davos Seaworth, the Onion Knight, was previously a smuggler/pirate who sneaked onions and other foodstuffs onto Stannis' besieged island fortress during the previous rebellion. In recognition for his gallantry and heroism, Stannis knighted him. And as punishment for his smuggling activities, he ordered the last joint of the fingers from one hand removed. He let Ser Davos choose which hand. Needless to say, loyalty like the Onion Knight's is very much the exception in Lord Stannis' court. The Lannisters seem to be moving closer and closer to this as the series goes on. In the fifth book, even random nobles on another continent spit at the sound of their family name. Even more so Cersei Lannister in particular, who managed to surprise even Magnificent Bastard Petyr Baelish with how fast she managed to alienate everyone and turn her control of the kingdoms into a disaster.\",\n",
